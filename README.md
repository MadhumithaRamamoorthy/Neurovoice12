Neurovoice is a brainprint based communication for mute and paralyzed people and it uses AI to predict the real time intent of the Paralyzed people
 NeuroVoice – Brainprint Based Communication System

## Overview
NeuroVoice is a brain-signal-based assistive communication system designed for individuals with severe speech and motor impairments. It captures EEG signals, processes them, and translates identifiable brain patterns into meaningful communication outputs.

The system is intended for individuals who are cognitively aware but unable to speak due to conditions such as ALS, stroke, spinal cord injury, or locked-in syndrome.

## Problem Statement
People with severe motor and speech impairments are unable to communicate effectively despite having intact cognitive abilities. This results in loss of independence, emotional distress, and social isolation.
